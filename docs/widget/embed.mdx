### Using simple js script (recommended)

1. Download the latest build from [GitHub](https://github.com/openchatai/OpenCopilot/actions)
   and extract the zip file.

2. Include the provided JavaScript file in the head of your document (use `https://robyn.zeonhq.com/pilot.js` for local setup).
   ```html
   <script src="https://cloud.opencopilot.so/pilot.js"></script>
   ```
3. Init the copilot (when document fully loads) by calling the `initAiCoPilot` function and passing the required options.

   ```html
   <script>
     const options = {
        apiUrl: "https://api.opencopilot.so/backend" // your base url where your are hosting OpenCopilot at (the API), usually it's https://robyn.zeonhq.com/backend
        socketUrl: "https://api.opencopilot.so" // your socket server, usually it's https://robyn.zeonhq.com/socket
        initialMessage: "Hey! happy to help.", // optional: you can pass an array of messages that will be sent to the copilot when it's initialized
        token: "your_copilot_token_goes_here", // you can get your token from the dashboard
        triggerSelector: "#triggerSelector", // the selector of the element that will trigger the copilot when clicked
        headers: {
          // optional: you can pass your authentication tokens to the copilot or any other header you want to send with every request
          Authorization: "Bearer your_auth_token_goes_here",
          AnyKey: "AnyValue"
        },
        containerProps: {
          // optional: you can pass any props to the container div
          className: "your-custom-class-name",
          style: {
              position: "fixed",
              height: "100%",
              bottom: "0",
              right: "0",
              width: "400px",
            },
        } 

      }
      window.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", ()=>initAiCoPilot(options)); // window.onload
   </script>
   ```

### As a React Component

1. Install the widget from npm.

   <Tabs>
     <Tab title="npm">
     ```bash

     <Tab title="pnpm">
     ```bash 
     pnpm add @openchatai/copilot-widget 
     ```
     </Tab>
   </Tabs>

2. Use the Component inside your application

```jsx
import { CopilotWidget,Root } from "@openchatai/copilot-widget"; // import the component
import '@openchatai/copilot-widget/index.css' // the required styles
const options = {
  apiUrl: "https://api.opencopilot.so/backend" // your base url where your are hosting OpenCopilot at (the API), usually it's https://robyn.zeonhq.com/backend
  socketUrl: "https://api.opencopilot.so" // your socket server, usually it's https://robyn.zeonhq.com/socket
  initialMessage: "Hey! happy to help.", // optional: you can pass an array of messages that will be sent to the copilot when it's initialized
  token: "your_copilot_token_goes_here", // you can get your token from the dashboard
  defaultOpen: true,
  headers: {
    // optional: you can pass your authentication tokens to the copilot or any other header you want to send with every request
    Authorization: "Bearer your_auth_token_goes_here",
    AnyKey: "AnyValue"
  },
}
const containerProps = {
  // optional: you can pass any props to the container div
  className: "your-custom-class-name",
  style: {
      position: "fixed",
      height: "100%",
      bottom: "0",
      right: "0",
      width: "400px",
    },
}
function Widget(){
  return (
    <Root containerProps={containerProps} options={options}>
    <CopilotWidget triggerSelector='#copilot-trigger' />
    </Root>
  )
}
```

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="I have a style conflict with the widget">
    The copilot is styled using
    [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) and all the classes are prefixed so it should not conflict with your
    exising style, however, if so, please feel free to [open an issue on our GitHub repo](https://github.com/openchatai/OpenCopilot/issues/new)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="The copilot widget is not showing up">
    Make sure that the `triggerSelector` is correct and the element exists in
    the dom, if that did not work, please [open an issue on our GitHub repo](https://github.com/openchatai/OpenCopilot/issues/new)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="The copilot widget is so small">
    The copilot widget is responsive and it's width is set to 100% by default, you can change that by passing the
    `containerProps` option and setting the width to whatever you want.
